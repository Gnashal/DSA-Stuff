A HASH IS WEHRE YOU HAVE KEY VALUE PAIRS, BUT YOU DEFINE THE KEYS; 

A collision is where you keys will have the same value

- Open Hashing
- CLosed Hashing 

So what makes a good Hash? 
- Fast (Constant time, o(1))
- Does not Cluster outputs at specific index. (It should not concentrate, but segregated )
    - Separate Chaining
    - Linear Probing
- Deterministic (same input yields same output, aka must be specific)

- Array Implementaion
