# TREES NOTES

## What is a tree :

- a data structure that consists of nodes in a <strong>parent/child</strong> relationship <br>
- is represented as the root from the top going down <br>
- if nodes that dont have children, are called 'leaves', and the one at the top is called the 'root node' <br>
- the 'height' of the tree is the size from the root node down to the leaf node <br>
- while depth is the number of children and it's siblings from their parents <br>
- Ancestors and Descendants <br>

## Lists vs Trees

- Lists = linear <br>
- Trees = non-linear <br>
- A tree is basically a combination of a lot of Linked Lists <br>

## Kinds of Trees

- Trees <br>
- Binary Trees <br>
- Binary Search Trees <br>

## Traversing a Tree

- Breadth-First Search <br>
- Depth-First Search <br>
  - Pre Order - NLR
  - In Order - LNR
  - Post Order - LRN

# Binary Search Tree

- Every Parents has at least two nodes (left & right) where the smaller values of the Parent is placed on the left and the bigger ones on the right <br>
- Every Parents needs to only have 2 children <br>
- This behaves recursiveley where the rule applies to all Parents <br>
